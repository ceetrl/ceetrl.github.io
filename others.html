            <h2 id="ideas">Anime Fandom Site</h2>
            <pre id="fandom">
    The first project idea I have is called "anime fandom site" for those who loves manga especially anime. The user interface is fit for any kind of anime genre and can easily be tweak to fit what it needs. It can be useful to those who are new to the anime or manga they are watching/reading. The interface has this simplicity that makes it easy to navigate but it has everything you need. From anime synopsis, characters that can be click to see more details about them, list of anime and manga to view in order which can be helpful if it has a lot of anime or manga published. It will also display official arts from the studio that created the manga and anime that animated it. If you want to find official tracks of the anime you watched, you can visit this site to easily find the songs you've been searching for for weeks. It will also include an updated announcements tab to keep up with. It will also have a tab of the latest manga chapter panel (once click it will take you to that current chapter it has). Lastly, it has an extra tab for any other necessary information to put. I think this would be a fun project to create with friends especially if the people who would be involve are manga/anime lovers.

            <h2 id="ideas">Recipe Guide</h2>
            <pre id="recipe">
    Second project idea is a recipe site, but with hundreds of different type of cuisines in the world it would be quite challenging to build a recipe site. That's why this project will focus on one and this recipe site will focus on Japanese Cuisine. This one won't need users to log in, this would be easy to use and navigate, user interface would be simple but organize. Below the search bar would be the different categories of Japanese Cuisine. Main page will also display the staple ingredients in Japanese Cuisine, popular dishes, and on the go recipes for a quick meal prep. Once a category name is clicked, it will take users to different page and it will showcase different menus that fits the description of the category name clicked. The third page it will show is on the right side, the longest one. Once a dish is chosen, it will take users to the main recipe page. The food name, description, ingredients, ingredients preparation, cooking instruction with a detailed step by step tutorial, and lastly a video embedded to make recipe easier to follow. This would be perfect for food lovers and fan of Japanese Cuisine who wants to try something but is not sure of what they want. They would have large selection of dishes, beverages, desserts, etc.

            <h2 id="ideas">Chatroom</h2>
            <pre id="chat">
        Last project idea is a chatroom. It's would be a simple messaging site where you and your friends can communicate with each other. It's like texting but without the use of mobile number. Users will either have to sign up or login to have access. You can add friends via their username and message them by tapping on their username or pfp. Once you send a message, the other end will receive it real-time and vice versa. You can also change your pfp or username on "My Profile" and you can find it by taping on the settings icon. Since you can login, of course you would also be able to logout of your account, or permanently delete them and all the data your account have will also be permanently deleted. It will just be a simple chatroom with direct functions. Other popular apps will still be better and have better functionality, but it can be a good group project idea to practice the basics and slowly add functionalities to this web. As the coders learn along the process, they will also have fun and collaborate ideas with the other people in their group.
